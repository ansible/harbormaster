Roadmap for Ansible Container
=============================

As the project evolves, a roadmap will be published for each major and minor release. Subminor versions will generally not
have a roadmap.

Comments, suggestions, and requests to the current roadmap are welcome. Our goal in publishing a roadmap is transparency
and community inclusion.

A roadmap is the team's *best guess* based on experience, community requests, and feedback. There are things that may not
be included due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc. There may be things we miss, so roadmaps are published
both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible Container, and as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community.

Ways to submit feedback:

  - `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_
  - #ansible-container IRC channel on irc.freenode.net
  - `Open an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_
  - Join us at the next `AnsibleFest or Red Hat Summit <https://www.ansible.com/blog/topic/ansiblefest>`_

0.3.0 Roadmap
=============

We are currently working on release 0.3.0. There may not be time to add additional
features at this point, as we were late getting this first roadmap published, but your feedback is still very important. If
we can't squeeze something in, we can certainly add it to the next release. Don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

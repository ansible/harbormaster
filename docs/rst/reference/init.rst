.. command::ansible-playbook init

The ``ansible-container init`` command initializes your project for use with
Ansible Container.

If you've got a project you'd like to build, run, and deploy with Ansible Container,
this command will bootstrap your project with some boilerplate files in the
``ansible/`` directory. The :doc:`/tour` document outlines the files created. You
should modify these for your needs.
